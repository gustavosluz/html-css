        </h1>

        <p>If you consider yourself a "cake enthusiast," you probably have fundamental memories of pouring boxed cake mix into a bowl and having a puff of flour poof up and cover your counters, or decorating your cake only to have half of the icing fall off onto the stand. While you can laugh about those memories now, it was probably hard to make a joke out of it in the moment — especially if the cake you were making was for a special occasion. If anything, these experiences likely taught you that making cake is actually much more difficult than it looks.
